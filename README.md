## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I will be honest, this is not my best work. Code could be written better and cleaner. For some reason, the error messages are not showing. I'm also having that problem again where the web page works in Google Chrome, but other browsers all elements are out of place. I definitely have alot more to learn and work on when using SCSS/CSS. I also need to work on the "divitis". 

For this project, the grade I've given myself is a C.
